### Full-Stack Take-Home Test: Todo List App

This task is designed to evaluate your skills in building a **Full-Stack Todo List App** using **Next.js**, **Express.js**, **Prisma**, and **MySQL**. **Entirely with Typescript, and then Tailwind CSS for frontend.** The goal is to assess your ability to design, build, and document a simple and functional application.

### **Objective**

Build a **Todo List App** where users can:

- Add tasks.
- Edit tasks.
- Mark tasks as Completed/Not Completed.
- Delete tasks.

---

### **Features**

### **1. Home View**

- Displays a list of tasks with:
  - **Title**.
  - Checkbox or toggle to mark as Completed/Not Completed.
  - Delete button.
- Includes:
  - **Create Task** button to navigate to a form for adding tasks.
  - A summary of tasks: "Tasks: X" and "Completed: Y of X".
- Clicking on a task card navigates to the **Edit Task Page**.

### **2. Create/Edit Task Page**

- A form with fields:
  - **Title** (required).
  - **Color** (selectable options, e.g., red, blue, green).
- Behavior:
  - **Create Task**: Saves a new task and redirects to the **Home View**.
  - **Edit Task**: Updates an existing task and redirects to the **Home View**.
  - Navigating back without saving discards changes.

### **3. Additional Features**

- Toggle a taskâ€™s completion status directly on the **Home View**.
- Delete tasks with a confirmation prompt.

### **Technical Requirements**

1. **Front-End**: Use **Next.js (App Router)**.
   - Follow the provided [Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/zHgJzVHfhuN720CjjSGRXQ/Todo-App-Test-Task?node-id=0-1&t=dcgTs4OsZGTxsIJj-1).
   - Ensure responsiveness and clean UI.
   - Use reusable components (e.g., Task Cards, Forms).
2. **Back-End**: Use **Express.js**.
   - REST API Endpoints:
     - `GET /tasks`
     - `POST /tasks`
     - `PUT /tasks/:id`
     - `DELETE /tasks/:id`
3. **Database**: Use **Prisma** with **MySQL**.
   - Tasks should include: `id`, `title`, `color`, `completed` status, and timestamps.
4. **Best Practices**:
   - Keep code clean and modular.
   - Implement basic validation and error handling.

### **Submission Guidelines**

1. Provide **two GitHub repositories**:
   - **Front-End**: Next.js app.
   - **Back-End**: Express.js API.
2. Include:
   - Clear setup instructions for both repos.
   - Steps for database initialization using Prisma.
